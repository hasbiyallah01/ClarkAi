# ClarkAI (Payment Module)

This repository contains the Payment Module of the ClarkAI Backend, built with .NET 8.
It powers the Paystack-based subscription flow for the [ClarkAI Frontend](https://github.com/segunojo1/clarkai-fe).

The ClarkAI Payment Module does all processes related to payment initialization, verification, and auto subscription.

## Features

* **Paystack Integration** â€“ payment initialization and verification using Paystackâ€™s API
* **Subscription Lifecycle** â€“ activate, renew, and cancel subscriptions securely
* **Duplicate Handling** â€“ concurrency-safe insertions with Postgres constraints
* **WebHook** â€“ to auto verify payment and do the required stuffs
* **Error-Handled Retry Mechanism** â€“ transient DB exceptions handled gracefully

## Tech Stack

* **Language**: C#
* **Framework**: .NET 8 Web API
* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **Payment Gateway**: Paystack
* **Architecture**: Onion

## My Contribution

I implemented the **payment subsystem**, including:

* Integration with Paystack for initializing and verifying payments
* Subscription validation and renewal logic
* Handling duplicate reference conflicts via Postgres constraints
* Asynchronous transaction safety with Unit of Work
* API endpoints for initializing and verifying payments
